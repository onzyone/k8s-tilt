# Ambassador

The Ambassador Edge Stack is a self-service, comprehensive edge stack that is Kubernetes-native and built on [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/).

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm repo add datawire https://getambassador.io
$ helm install ambassador datawire/ambassador
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps an [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io) deployment on
a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.11+

## Add this Helm repository to your Helm client

```console
helm repo add datawire https://getambassador.io
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ kubectl create namespace ambassador
$ helm install my-release datawire/ambassador -n ambassador
```

The command deploys Ambassador Edge Stack in the ambassador namespace on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

It is recommended to use the ambassador namespace for easy upgrades.

The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Changelog

Notable chart changes are listed in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/ambassador/CHANGELOG.md)

## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the Ambassador chart and their default values.

### The Ambasssador Edge Stack

The Ambassador Edge Stack provides a comprehensive, self-service edge stack in 
the Kubernetes cluster with a decentralized deployment model and a declarative 
paradigm. 

By default, this chart will install the latest image of The Ambassador Edge 
Stack which will replace your existing deployment of Ambassador with no changes
to functionality.

See the installation notes for instructions on how to enable the advanced 
features of The Ambassador Edge Stack.

To install the Ambassador API Gateway, simply change the `image` to your
desired version of the Ambassador API Gateway.

### CRDs 

This helm chart includes the creation of the core CRDs Ambassador uses for
configuration. 

The `crds` flags (Helm 2 only) let you configure how a release manages crds.
- `crds.create` Can only be set on your first/master Ambassador release. 
- `crds.enabled` Should be set on all releases using Ambassador CRDs
- `crds.keep` Configures if the CRDs are deleted when the master release is 
  purged. This value is only checked for the master release and can be set to
  any value on secondary releases. 

### Annotations

Ambassador is configured using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). If you are unable to use CRDs, Ambassador can also be configured using annotations on services. The `service.annotations` section of the values file contains commented out examples of [Ambassador Module](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/core/ambassador) and a global [TLSContext](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/core/tls) configurations which are typically created in the Ambassador service.

If you intend to use `service.annotations`, remember to include the `getambassador.io/config` annotation key as above.

### Prometheus Metrics

Using the Prometheus Exporter has been deprecated and is no longer recommended.

Please see Ambassador's [monitoring with Prometheus](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/monitoring/) docs for more information on using the `/metrics` endpoint for metrics collection.

### Ambassador Pro (NO LONGER SUPPORTED: Please upgrade to Ambassador Edge Stack)

Setting `pro.enabled: true` will install Ambassador Pro as a sidecar to Ambassador with the required CRDs and redis instance.

You must set the `pro.licenseKey.value` to the license key issued to you. Sign up for a [free trial](https://www.getambassador.io/pro/free-trial) of Ambassador Pro or [contact](https://www.getambassador.io/contact) our sales team to obtain a license key.

`pro.ports.auth` and `pro.ports.ratelimit` must be the same value. If changing one, you must change the other.

For most use cases, `pro.image` and `pro.ports` can be left as default.

#### Ambassador Pro Environment (NO LONGER SUPPORTED: Please upgrade to Ambassador Edge Stack)

Click [here](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/pro/environment/) for full information regarding the different environment variables for Ambassador Pro.

Some environment variables are set by default. Some of these are configurable in the `Values` file.

| Environment Variable     | Default Value                     | Configurable     |

Additional environment variables can be set with `pro.env`

**Note**: The Ambassador Pro container uses the same `AMBASSADOR_ID` as set in `env` for the Ambassador container. Setting `AMBASSADOR_ID` with `pro.env` will be ignored.

### Specifying Values

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
$ helm install --wait my-release \
    --set adminService.type=NodePort \
    datawire/ambassador
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install --wait my-release -f values.yaml datawire/ambassador
```

# Upgrading

## To 6.0.0

Introduces Ambassador Edge Stack being installed by default.

### Breaking changes

Ambassador Pro support has been removed in 6.0.0. Please [upgrade to the Ambassador Edge Stack](https://www.getambassador.io/yaml/user-guide/helm).

## To 5.0.0

### Breaking changes

**Note** If upgrading an existing helm 2 installation no action is needed, previously installed CRDs will not be modified.

- Helm 3 support for CRDs was added. Specifically, the CRD templates were moved to non-templated files in the `/crds` directory, and to keep Helm 2 support they are globbed from there by `/templates/crds.yaml`. However, because Helm 3 CRDs are not templated, the labels for new installations have necessarily changed

## To 4.0.0

The 4.0.0 chart contains a number of changes to the way Ambassador Pro is installed.

- Introduces the performance tuned and certified build of open source Ambassador, Ambassador core
- The license key is now stored and read from a Kubernetes secret by default
- Added `.Values.pro.licenseKey.secret.enabled` `.Values.pro.licenseKey.secret.create` fields to allow multiple releases in the same namespace to use the same license key secret.
- Introduces the ability to configure resource limits for both Ambassador Pro and it's redis instance
- Introduces the ability to configure additional `AuthService` options (see [AuthService documentation](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service/))
- The ambassador-pro-auth `AuthService` and ambassador-pro-ratelimit `RateLimitService` and now created as CRDs when `.Values.crds.enabled: true`
- Fixed misnamed selector for redis instance that failed in an edge case
- Exposes annotations for redis deployment and service

### Breaking changes

The value of `.Values.pro.image.tag` has been shortened to assume `amb-sidecar` (and `amb-core` for Ambassador core)
`values.yaml`
```diff
<3.0.0>
  image:
    repository: quay.io/datawire/ambassador_pro
-    tag: amb-sidecar-0.6.0

<4.0.0+>
  image:
    repository: quay.io/datawire/ambassador_pro
+    tag: 0.7.0
```

Method for creating a Kubernetes secret to hold the license key has been changed

`values.yaml`
```diff
<3.0.0>
-    secret: false
<4.0.0>
+    secret:
+      enabled: true
+      create: true
```

## To 3.0.0

### Service Ports

The way ports are assigned has been changed for a more dynamic method.

Now, instead of setting the port assignments for only the http and https, any port can be open on the load balancer using a list like you would in a standard Kubernetes YAML manifest.

`pre-3.0.0`
```yaml
service:
  http:
    enabled: true
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  https:
    enabled: true
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
```

`3.0.0`
```yaml
service:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
```

This change has also replaced the `.additionalTCPPorts` configuration. Additional TCP ports can be created the same as the http and https ports above.

### Annotations and `service_port` 

The below Ambassador `Module` annotation is no longer being applied by default. 

```yaml
getambassador.io/config: |
  ---
  apiVersion: ambassador/v1
  kind: Module
  name: ambassador
  config:
    service_port: 8080
```
This was causing confusion with the `service_port` being hard-coded when enabling TLS termination in Ambassador.

Ambassador has been listening on port 8080 for HTTP and 8443 for HTTPS by default since version `0.60.0` (chart version 2.2.0). 

### RBAC and CRDs

A `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` named `{{release name}}-crd` will be created to watch for the Ambassador Custom Resource Definitions. This will be created regardless of the value of `scope.singleNamespace` since CRDs are created the cluster scope.

`rbac.namespaced` has been removed. For namespaced RBAC, set `scope.singleNamespace: true` and `rbac.enabled: true`.

`crds.enabled` will indicate that you are using CRDs and will create the rbac resources regardless of the value of `crds.create`. This allows for multiple deployments to use the CRDs.

## To 2.0.0

### Ambassador ID

ambassador.id has been removed in favor of setting it via an environment variable in `env`. `AMBASSADOR_ID` defaults to `default` if not set in the environment. This is mainly used for [running multiple Ambassadors](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/running#ambassador_id) in the same cluster.

| Parameter       | Env variables   |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| `ambassador.id` | `AMBASSADOR_ID` |

## Migrating from `datawire/ambassador` chart (chart version 0.40.0 or 0.50.0)

Chart now runs ambassador as non-root by default, so you might need to update your ambassador module config to match this.

### Timings

Timings values have been removed in favor of setting the env variables using `env´

| Parameter         | Env variables              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| `timing.restart`  | `AMBASSADOR_RESTART_TIME`  |
| `timing.drain`    | `AMBASSADOR_DRAIN_TIME`    |
| `timing.shutdown` | `AMBASSADOR_SHUTDOWN_TIME` |

### Single namespace

| Parameter          | Env variables                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `namespace.single` | `AMBASSADOR_SINGLE_NAMESPACE` |

### Renamed values

Service ports values have changed names and target ports have new defaults.

| Previous parameter          | New parameter              | New default value |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `service.enableHttp`        | `service.http.enabled`     |                   |
| `service.httpPort`          | `service.http.port`        |                   |
| `service.httpNodePort`      | `service.http.nodePort`    |                   |
| `service.targetPorts.http`  | `service.http.targetPort`  | `8080`            |
| `service.enableHttps`       | `service.https.enabled`    |                   |
| `service.httpsPort`         | `service.https.port`       |                   |
| `service.httpsNodePort`     | `service.https.nodePort`   |                   |
| `service.targetPorts.https` | `service.https.targetPort` | `8443`            |

### Exporter sidecar

Pre version `0.50.0` ambassador was using socat and required a sidecar to export statsd metrics. In `0.50.0` ambassador no longer uses socat and doesn't need a sidecar anymore to export its statsd metrics. Statsd metrics are disabled by default and can be enabled by setting environment `STATSD_ENABLED`, this will (in 0.50) send metrics to a service named `statsd-sink`, if you want to send it to another service or namespace it can be changed by setting `STATSD_HOST`

If you are using prometheus the chart allows you to enable a sidecar which can export to prometheus see the `prometheusExporter` values.
